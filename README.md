# learning-rust

This repo is now archived. I tried hard to appreciate Rust and its philosophy but I couldn't really justify switching from C/C++ to Rust for performance-intensive programming. RAII isn't actually a problem unless you make it so. A programmer should be responsible for their code instead of just letting the language handle everything. And then there are other very good languages (e.g. Go) with garbage collection, if that's your forte. 

I felt like Rust makes it what we can formally call a juxtaposition, on one hand it promises not to hold your hand but at the same time, holds you back with unnecessary borrow checking for the simplest of cases. Null checking has been there since eternity, so are exceptions (which Rust doesn't have and wants you to handle panic cases which makes its own nested code hell). 

So, for now, I've stopped doing anything with Rust. May be in the future if I see a better use case for it.
